### Description

The purpose of this assigment is to refactor some given code to make it more accessible. This is my first attempt at refactoring code.

#### Things done to **increase accessibility** on HTML file:

- Changed the title in the header to something more appropriate.
- Ensured all links worked properly.
- Added alt text for all images.
- Verified self-closing tags were actually self closing
- Verified heading attributes were in sequential order
- Changed some div tags to more semantic tags

#### Things done to **consolidate CSS** to make more efficient and easier to read

- Consolidated any selectors together that had the same stylings
- Added notes to more easily identify selectors
- Changed selectors so they matched the more semantic HTML tags
- Moved some items around so it made more sense when reading from top down following the html
